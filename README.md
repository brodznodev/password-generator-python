# 🔐 Password Generator (Python)

Generate secure and robust passwords in Python, avoiding weak patterns and predictable sequences. This generator is designed to maximize security and ease of use.

## 🛡️ Features

- Minimum 12 characters per password
- Includes at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one digit, and one special character
- Avoids common words and weak patterns (e.g., "password", "123456", "qwerty")
- Detects and avoids alphabetical/numeric sequences (e.g., "abcd", "1234")
- Prevents simple repetitions (e.g., "aaaa", "1111")
- Uses the `secrets` module for maximum cryptographic security

## 🚀 Quick Installation & Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brodznodev/password-generator-python.git
cd password-generator-python
python generator.py
```

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies required

## 📝 Example Usage in Code

```python
from generator import generate_password

password = generate_password(16)
print(password)  # Example output: K!4xg3$M7qRaZ9dQ
```

## 🔒 Security

This generator uses Python's standard `secrets` module to ensure cryptographic randomness. It also implements validations to avoid weak passwords, sequences, and repetitions, guaranteeing each password is unique and hard to guess.
